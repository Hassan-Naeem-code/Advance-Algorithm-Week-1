# Contributing

Thanks for your interest in this project. The repository is structured to be
simple and reproducible for the Week 1 assignment.

Guidelines
- Create a new branch for any non-trivial work: git checkout -b feat/your-feature
- Run unit tests locally: conda run -n week1 pytest -q
- Format code with black and isort before committing. If you installed pre-commit, hooks will run automatically.

Pull request checklist
- All tests pass (pytest)
- No new lint errors (flake8)
- Add/update unit tests for new behavior

Contact
- If you want feedback on the assignment or help preparing slides/video, create an issue.
